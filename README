# Login and shutdown script for Mac OS X 10.4 to do two things:
#   1. Redirect network users' ~/Library/Caches folder to the local hard disk
#      for better performance, and
#   2. Expire (remove) portable home directories on lab computers after 
#      a period of inactivity (default to 30 days)

# The cache folder part is adapted from a shell script by Nigel Kirsten

# The expiring mobile directories part is adapted from a login hook by
